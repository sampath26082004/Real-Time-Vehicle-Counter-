# 🚗 Real-Time Vehicle Detection and Counting using OpenCV

This project is a Python-based computer vision application that detects and counts vehicles from a video file using OpenCV and background subtraction techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time vehicle detection from video input  
- Counts vehicles that cross a virtual line  
- Uses background subtraction (MOG) for motion detection  
- Displays detected vehicles and count on video frame  
- Assigns basic IDs to detected vehicles for tracking  

## 🎥 Demo

> Upload your video (`Video.mp4`) in the root directory of this project to see the real-time vehicle count.

*Replace with your actual demo GIF or image.*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- BackgroundSubtractorMOG (from `cv2.bgsegm`)
  
## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── vehicle_counter.py     # Main Python script
├── Video.mp4              # Input video (not included in repo)
└── README.md              # Project documentation

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-detection-opencv.git
   cd vehicle-detection-opencv
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
   ```

3. **Add your video:**

   * Place your vehicle video file in the project folder and rename it to `Video.mp4`.

4. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python vehicle_counter.py
   ```

5. **Exit the window:**

   * Press `Enter` key while the video window is active.

## 📈 Output

* Displays a live video feed with bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
* A virtual line is drawn across the frame — vehicles crossing the line are counted.
* Console logs each vehicle counted.

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (cv2)
* NumPy

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Speed estimation for each vehicle
* Save vehicle counts to a CSV file
* Detect different types of vehicles (car, bike, bus)
* Integration with real-time camera feed

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

* Background subtraction and contour detection techniques inspired by OpenCV tutorials.
